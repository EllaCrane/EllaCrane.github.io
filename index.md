My goal is to enable quantum simulation of nature using error-corrected quantum computers made of qubits, fermions, and bosons (see [Qiskit Seminar Series](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5dyUNsh8Q9E&ved=2ahUKEwiPy9OO2oKLAxVGvokEHcm7ArYQwqsBegQIDRAE&usg=AOvVaw3ueBJk0AdnNi4DKtmB0Hty)). Find my published and peer-reviewed articles on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b8v4d0sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra) and the wonderful, open access (non-peer reviewed) [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/search/quant-ph?searchtype=author&query=Crane,+E).

I research and teach quantum policy for [Defense, Emerging Technology, and Strategy](https://www.belfercenter.org/programs/defense-emerging-technology-and-strategy) with Eric Rosenbach at the [Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org) at the [Harvard Kennedy School of Government](https://www.hks.harvard.edu).

Previously, I did a [postdoc at MIT](https://meche.mit.edu/people/staff/emc2@mit.edu), working with Seth Lloyd and Isaac Chuang. I was a board member of the [MIT European Club](https://euroclub.mit.edu/board). Organised the [MIT European Career Fair](https://euro-career.mit.edu). Organised the [Harvard European Conference](https://euroconf.eu). Was a teaching assistant for leadership course [LEAPS](https://physics.mit.edu/academic-programs/subjects/mitleaps/) (MIT). Completed  [Transforming Systems](https://locator.tlt.harvard.edu/course/gse-205506/2025/spring/19970) (Harvard), and [Adaptive Leadership](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/practice-adaptive-leadership-tools-and-tactics-changing-your-organization-and-world) (Harvard). Grew up in a superposition of England and France, and enjoy adventures, whatever the nature.
