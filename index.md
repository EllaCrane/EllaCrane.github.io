## Goal

My goal is to enable quantum simulation of nature using error-corrected quantum computers made of qubits, fermions, and bosons to become a reality.

## About Me

I grew up in a superposition of England and France, and enjoy adventures, whatever the nature.
On the board of the MIT European Club, and organising the [Harvard European Conference](https://euroconf.eu) and the MIT European Career Fair.
