## Goal

My goal is to enable quantum simulation of nature using error-corrected quantum computers made of qubits, fermions, and bosons to become a reality.

## About Me

I grew up in a superposition of England and France, and enjoy adventures, whatever the nature.

## News

- **[Nov. 2024]** Our preprint on fermion-qubit error correction has appeared on the arXiv.
