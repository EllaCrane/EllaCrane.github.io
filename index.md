[Postdoc at MIT](https://meche.mit.edu/people/staff/emc2@mit.edu), working with Seth Lloyd. My goal is to enable quantum simulation of nature using error-corrected quantum computers made of qubits, fermions, and bosons (see [Qiskit Seminar Series](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5dyUNsh8Q9E&ved=2ahUKEwiPy9OO2oKLAxVGvokEHcm7ArYQwqsBegQIDRAE&usg=AOvVaw3ueBJk0AdnNi4DKtmB0Hty)).

## News

- **[Apr. 2025]** Very excited to share that I have become a non-resident fellow at the [Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs](https://www.belfercenter.org) at the [Harvard Kennedy School of Government](https://www.hks.harvard.edu)!
- **[Apr. 2025]** Our preprint about [compiler optimization for Hamiltonian simulation using partial Trotterization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03747) has appeared on the arXiv.
- **[Mar. 2025]** Our preprint on the [phases of the Z2 Higgs lattice gauge theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03828) has appeared on the arXiv.
- **[Jan. 2025]** The [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2464444-elusive-phase-change-finally-spotted-in-a-quantum-simulator/) wrote a great summary of our first observation of a finite-energy phase transition in one dimension.
- **[Jan. 2025]** Our paper on the first observation of a finite-energy phase transition in 1D has appeared in [Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02751-2). A big thanks to Alexander Schuckert, Or Katz and Chris Monroe!
- **[Jan. 2024]** Creation of the [Giggly Bit!](https://www.sundai.club/projects/ac655b49-d001-4f1c-82a9-bfb7bf37db44) You laugh, it laughs, it makes you laugh, it laughs, everyone laughs.

- **[Nov. 2024]** Our preprint on [fermion-qubit error correction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08955) has appeared on the arXiv. Exponential advantage from O(N) to O(log N) for the quantum simulation of crystalline molecules or materials! Incredible work, Alexander Schuckert, and Michael Gullans.
- **[Sept. 2024]** Our preprint on [qubit-oscillator quantum simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03747) has appeared on the arXiv. Hurray! Here we propose a very promising approach to simulating fermion-boson models using native qubit-boson hardware, with the example of high-energy physics models. Thank you Nathan Wiebe and Steve Girvin. Years of hard work!
