## Research Interest: Quantum Simulation

- **Quantum Computation using native particles:** Can we more efficiently simulate interacting systems consisting of the two fundamental particles in Nature - bosons and fermions - by using quantum computers built from bosons and fermions (rather than qubits)?
- **Thermal State Preparation:** Can we find ways of preparing low (but finite) temperature states that is more efficient than ground-state preparation? Does this enable us to solve problems using quantum computers that we couldn't solve using classical computers?
- **Near-term fault-tolerant quantum computation:** Can we solve non-trivial problems with a small, (partially) fault-tolerant quantum computer? 

## News

- **[Nov. 2024]** Our preprint on fermion-qubit error correction has appeared on the arXiv.
