## Goal

My goal is to enable quantum simulation of nature using error-corrected quantum computers made of qubits, fermions, and bosons.

For the key ideas, watch this [Qiskit Seminar Series](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5dyUNsh8Q9E&ved=2ahUKEwiPy9OO2oKLAxVGvokEHcm7ArYQwqsBegQIDRAE&usg=AOvVaw3ueBJk0AdnNi4DKtmB0Hty) episode I was invited to by the wonderful Zlatko Minev!

## About Me

I grew up in a superposition of England and France, and enjoy adventures, whatever the nature.

On the board of the [MIT European Club](https://euroclub.mit.edu/board), and organising the [Harvard European Conference](https://euroconf.eu) and the [MIT European Career Fair](https://euro-career.mit.edu).

## News

- **[Jan. 2025]** The [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2464444-elusive-phase-change-finally-spotted-in-a-quantum-simulator/) wrote a great summary of our first observation of a finite-energy phase transition in one dimension.
- **[Jan. 2025]** Our paper on the first observation of a finite-energy phase transition in 1D has appeared in [Nature Physics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-024-02751-2). A big thanks to Alexander Schuckert, Or Katz and Chris Monroe!
- **[Jan. 2024]** Creation of the [Giggly Bit!](https://www.sundai.club/projects/ac655b49-d001-4f1c-82a9-bfb7bf37db44) You laugh, it laughs, it makes you laugh, it laughs, everyone laughs.
- **[Dec. 2024]** Completed the [Adaptive Leadership](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/publications/practice-adaptive-leadership-tools-and-tactics-changing-your-organization-and-world) course at the Harvard Kennedy School.
- **[Nov. 2024]** Our preprint on [fermion-qubit error correction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08955) has appeared on the arXiv. Exponential advantage from O(N) to O(log N) for the quantum simulation of crystalline molecules or materials! Incredible work, Alexander Schuckert, and Michael Gullans.
- **[Sept. 2024]** Our preprint on [qubit-oscillator quantum simulation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03747) has appeared on the arXiv. Hurray! Here we propose a very promising approach to simulating fermion-boson models using native qubit-boson hardware, with the example of high-energy physics models. Thank you Nathan Wiebe and Steve Girvin. Years of hard work!
- **[Aug. 2024]** Our preprint on [qubit-oscillator quantum architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10381) has appeared on the arXiv.
